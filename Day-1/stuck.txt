ALWAYS capitalize react component names!!!!! otherwise it will think its a html tag like <img> or <div></div>

React components under the hood are actually just javascript pojos

You can nest other jsx componenets in a component 
Must always signify the end of the componenet with />

JSX syntax is defined in React

A js object is returned when you console log a componenet  
    which are react elements that describe 
    what react sould eventually add to the
    DOM For use

All JSX must be nested under a single parent elements
can wrap JSX is <> </> which is a Fragment

Delcarative vs Imperative
    Delcarative: tell program what to acomlplish and
    it would know what to Do and how to handle the 
    details
        Make a pbj: tell a friend to make a pbj and u 
        assume they would know how to make it 
    Imperative: we need to tell the computer step by step what to document
        Make a pbj: must tell your friend exactly how to make it

to be composable?
    you have small pieces that can be put together to
    make something larger and greater than the individual
    pieces
====
Conventions to follow for components:
    1. Capitalize the first letter of componeent
    2. instead of calling the function with paren,
warpa with < />
